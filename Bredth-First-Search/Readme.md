        // Undirected graph vs Directed graph vs. Weighted graph
            // Undirected
                // A Graph in which all the edges do not point in a specific direction.
            // Directed
                // A Graph in which all the edges are pointed in a single direction.
            // Weighted Graph
                // A Graph that has a value associated with every edge. The values corresponding to the edges are called weights. A value in a weighted Graph can represent things depending on what you will use such as distance, and time.

        // A Graph is a non-linear data structure like a Tree, and it is a collection of nodes that are connected to other nodes by edges.
        // The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices (plural of vertex) and the edges are lines that connect any two nodes or vertices in the Graph.

        // Graph Representation
            // 1) Adjacency Matrix
            // 2) Adjacency List

        // Traversal means to visit each node of a Graph. For Graphs, there are two types of traversals:
            // Depth First traversal ( is a traversal technique in which we traverse all the nodes of the Graph in a breadth-wise motion. In BFS, we traverse one level at a time and then jump to the next level.)
            // Breadth-First traversal
